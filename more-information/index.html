                        and Mafia III: Definitive Edition—give you a bevy of choices for how you want the main character

                        collection in each Definitive Edition game just by signing up for a free 2K Account and logging
                        in
                        next time you play.

                        First, sign up for a 2K Account. Once you've created and verified your 2K Account, you can link
                        your account to your platforms of choice, including those where you own any of the Mafia:
                        Trilogy
                        games.

                        When you start up one of the Definitive Edition games while connected to the internet, you'll
                        also
                        see a prompt to create or sign in to your 2K Account. Once you've logged in, your rewards for
                        that
                        game will unlock instantly, and will be part of your collection on that platform from then on
                        whether or not you're logged in to your 2K Account. If you delete your save or uninstall the
                        game,
                        simply log in to your 2K Account again to reclaim your items.
